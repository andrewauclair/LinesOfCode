internals:

cmake frontend
    uses the cmake query/reply cmake-file-api to get info for the cmake build and produces an internal representation of the targets and files

vs frontend
    reads Visual Studio .sln/.vcxproj files to create an internal representation of the executables, libraries and their files

counter backend
    takes the ir created by the frontends and generates line counts

output backend
    takes the output of the counter backend and formats it to several different types, selectable from the command line with the following options:

    console (default)
        outputs stats to the console

    json
        outputs stats into a json file that can be reused later for comparisons

    csv
        outputs stats in a csv format that can be imported to excel

    graph
        outputs stats as images generated by gnuplot
